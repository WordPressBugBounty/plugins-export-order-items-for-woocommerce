== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why I see additional decimal places in some fields?

In some cases output may be affected by the limited precision of PHP's floating point numbers (see the warning in the PHP manual: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.float.php). This may occur retrieving values from the database, when the plugin does calculations after retrieving values from the database, such as when a report field consists of two database fields added together, or when calculating the totals row. When this occurs, a tiny fractional error may be introduced each time a calculation is performed, typically less than 0.000000000000001 per calculation or retrieval. This is not likely to affect the accuracy of the output in normal usage where only a few decimal places are used, even if a value has been derived from many calculations such as the totals row in a very long report. However, if output rounding is not in effect, you may see unexpected additional decimal places in some fields in your output. In this case we recommend rounding the output values as needed.


= What’s the difference between Export Order Items and Product Sales Report? =

Export Order Items generates a report with the items from an individual order, specific purchase, or specific customer for order fulfillment or accounting. [Product Sales Report](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-sales-report-for-woocommerce/) is for creating a report about all your products or a group of products for comparison and sales performance.
= Can I schedule my reports to send automatically? =

We built [Scheduled Email Reports for WooCommerce](https://wpzone.co/product/scheduled-email-reports-for-woocommerce/) as a premium add-on that can be used to schedule reports from both Export Order Items and Product Sales Report.

= Where can I get your other add-ons for WooCommerce? =
